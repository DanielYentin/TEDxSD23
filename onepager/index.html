            <h3>What is rust?</h3>
            <p>
                Rust is commonly described as a "memory safe, compiled languages with high level simplicity, and low level performance."
                Lets go through each of these one by one, and discuss what it means.

                1. "compiled": this one is very simple, and it just means that before you can execute you code, you need to first compile it into an intermediate file. This is in contrast to JIT (just in time) languages like python, which execute the file directly.
